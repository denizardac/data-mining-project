Comparing the Performance of Classification Algorithms for Predicting Grain Yield

This project investigates the performance of supervised machine learning classification algorithms on agricultural data, specifically focusing on predicting the GrainYield attribute, categorized into three classes: 'C', 'B', 'A'. The study involves data preprocessing, imputation of missing values, feature selection, and model evaluation using 5-fold stratified cross-validation. Ten classification algorithms, including RandomForest, GradientBoosting, and Support Vector Machines, are assessed for performance metrics such as Classification Accuracy (CA), Area Under the Curve (AUC), F1 Score, Precision, Recall, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC). The project explores the impact of categorical attributes (State, LandType, SoilType, SowingSchedule, and VarietyClass) on classification accuracy. By applying feature selection techniques, we compare results before and after feature selection to highlight significant predictors. Insights derived aim to provide actionable knowledge for optimizing agricultural practices and enhancing machine learning applications in the agricultural domain.
